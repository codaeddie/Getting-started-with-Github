## Using Ubuntu
### Lets run through some commands and intro to github through command line 

_Remember_ if you are having any troubles, a good starting point will always be using the ```--help``` command after your argument

Getting started with this project:
```
git branch --help
git status
git branch

git add
git commit
```

- [x] Create Repo 
- [x] Push Code from Local Machine into Repo
- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete :tada:

```
## Code Blocks 
We can segment code blocks and provide language-specific code matches

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
